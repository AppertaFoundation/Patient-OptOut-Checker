  This app has been developed to ensure University Hospital Plymouth NHS Trust complies with the NHS National Data Opt Out Programme.
  <br/><br/>
  National Data Opt Out applies to some national audits and research. This means that the Trust must not submit data for patients who have opted out.
  <br/><br/>
  The app allows staff responsible for entering data for these audits and research to check the patientsâ€™ opt out status.
  <br/><br/>
  For more information about the National Data Opt Out Programme please see the national guidance from NHS Digital:
  <a href="https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-data-opt-out">https://digital.nhs.uk/services/national-data-opt-out</a> and our Trust Privacy Notice:
